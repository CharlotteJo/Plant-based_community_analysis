The analysis made in the EDA and the dashboard revealed some interesting information about the users
and their preferences.

In fact we now know that the majority of the members likes to challenge themselves by cooking dishes that are difficult to prepare and by trying new and different recipes that are not typical in their country. 
In fact the users choose recipes with an __advanced level__ 45% of the time and the __ethnic__ category, alone, characterizes almost 35% of all the recipes reproduced.
We should then elaborate a strategy to attract more users like them and match our offer with their preferences.

The most valuable users personas for the community are then Monica Geller and The boys, in fact they represent 69% of the members, they usually give good scores to the recipes and they are competitive and they like challenge.

### How can we attract these users personas?
In order to encourage new users like them to subscribe we could add these two new challenges :
- Challenge __The champion__ : users have to replicate the 10 most difficult recipes of the community.
- Challenge __The traveler__ : Users have to replicate 5 different recipes that come from 5 different countries.

Every member that completes a challenge should then receive a badge
and every 12 weeks the users that got all the badges will be awarded and they will have the possibility to post a recipe that they invented so that they can inspire other people and create connections inside the community.
