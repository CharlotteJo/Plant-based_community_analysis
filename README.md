# Plant-based_community_analysis
The goal of this project is the suggestion of a strategy for a community of plant-based recipes. 
The work is divided in three parts: 

- An Exploratory Data Analysis that gives us an overview of the usersâ€™ behavior
- A dashboard that shows the results of the analysis and the creation of users personas
- The elaboration of a strategy
